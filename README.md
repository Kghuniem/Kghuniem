## 🌱 About Me

Hi! I'm Khadiga — a self-taught developer currently diving into the world of **front-end web development**.  
I studied Communication Engineering 🎓 but didn’t work in the field — instead, I followed my curiosity into the world of programming.

My journey began with **Python**, where I built small projects and explored the foundations of coding. 🐍  
Now, I’m excited to be learning **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and all things front-end! 🚀

I'm proudly balancing motherhood and learning as a mom of two — proving that it's never too late to start something new! 💖

When I'm not coding, I love:

📚 Reading  
🚶‍♀️ Long walks  
☕ Quiet moments with coffee and a good book
